Following an in-depth analysis of the assembly line project, I identified certain inefficiencies and introduced a new strategy, which was subsequently simulated.

		<strong>Customer-Satisfaction Analysis at SAN FRANCISCO International Airport</strong> <br/>
This study conducts an in-depth statistical analysis to pinpoint the key factors influencing customer satisfaction at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Utilizing a dataset comprised of over 3,000 customer responses from a mid-2013 survey, we employ a stepwise linear multiple regression model to identify the significant drivers of overall satisfaction. Our analysis reveals several impactful variables, with the majority exhibiting a consistent trend: extreme ratings on the scale ('Unacceptable' and 'Outstanding') have the most substantial impact.<br/>

		<strong>Determining Key Factors in Consumer Evaluation of an Airport</strong> <br/>
In this research, factor analysis is utilized to systematically investigate eleven variables related to service attributes and usage at San Francisco Airport (SFO). The primary objective is to decipher the underlying factorial structure that significantly influences a customer's comprehensive rating of SFO. A stepwise logistic regression analysis is subsequently applied, treating these derived factors as independent variables, and the comprehensive assessment of SFO as the dependent variable. This rigorous statistical approach allows for a detailed examination of the exact influence each of these factors has on the overall evaluation of SFO. <br/>

        <strong>SignAvatar: Sign Language 3D Motion Reconstruction and Generation (under review)</strong> <br/>
        Sign language (SL) 3D motion reconstruction and automatic generation help alleviate communication barriers between deaf and hearing communities, 
		promote multi-modal integration, and enable AR/VR applications. Word-level isolated signs are crucial for SL learning, 
		recognition, and sentence synthesis, as they are in all languages. However, achieving expressive 3D motion reconstruction 
		and generation for such isolated signs presents challenges due to the lack of expressive 3D data, complex and nuances of motions, 
		and the cross-modal apprehension of semantics. To address these challenges, we introduce SignAvatar, 
		a framework capable of both SL reconstruction and generation. SignAvatar employs a transformer-based conditional variational autoencoder architecture, 
		effectively establishing relationships across different modalities of semantics. 
		Additionally, our approach incorporates a curriculum learning strategy to enhance the model's generalization, 
		resulting in more realistic motion.Furthermore, we contribute the ASLGloss30 dataset for 3D sign motion approach, ensuring its 
		quality through rigorous quality control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SignAvatar through extensive experiments, showcasing its superior 
		reconstruction and automatic generation capabilities.

		<strong>Predicting One-step Proofs in Formal Mathematics using Transformer-based Neural Networks</strong> <br/>
This research investigates the potential of transformer models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in Automated Theorem Proving (ATP). It centers on applying these models within the Metamath data set, Set.mm, and treats proof verification as a sequence-to-sequence problem. This innovative approach capitalizes on the logical chain relationships inherent in mathematical proofs, offering fresh insights into the potential of AI in this domain. The paper discusses the complexities and challenges of integrating AI techniques into the field of mathematics, setting the stage for future advancements in AI-driven theorem proving. Our method not only opens up new possibilities in Automated Theorem Proving but also demonstrates promising results in leveraging AI for complex mathematical tasks.<br/>
